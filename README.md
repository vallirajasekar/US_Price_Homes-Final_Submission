# US_Price_Homes-Final_Submission
Our aim is to find publicly available data for key *supply-demand* factors that influence US home prices *nationally*. Then, build a data science model that explains how these factors impacted home prices over the last 20 years. Use the S&amp;P Case-Schiller Home Price Index as a proxy for home prices: fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CSUSHPISA.

# Factors that influence US home prices:
The assignment utilizes Three primary datasets: Supply,Demand,Other Factor. 
These datasets provide monthly data pertaining to crucial factors affecting national home prices in the United States.

# Stages in Prediction
Data Collection: Gathering data from various sources, including government agencies, private datasets, real estate reports, and articles related to housing and real estate across different U.S. states. This comprehensive dataset encompasses diverse aspects such as GDP and unemployment data.(Datasets are gathered in Jupyter Notebook)

Statistical Analysis: Analyzing the collected data, performing data preprocessing, and applying exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques. This step helps gain insights into the dataset, understand its characteristics, and identify patterns and trends.

Scaling: Applying Min-Max scaling to standardize the data and ensure consistency in the value ranges across different features. This preprocessing step is crucial for certain machine learning algorithms.

Model Building & Evaluation: Developing predictive models using various machine learning algorithms. The models are evaluated using performance metrics such as R-squared (R2) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) to assess their predictive accuracy.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tuning the models through hyperparameter optimization using techniques like grid search. This step aims to enhance the models' performance and make them more accurate in predicting housing-related trends

Prediction Insights: Offer insights into the predictions made by the models. Analyze how well the models capture real-world housing price fluctuations and their ability to provide accurate forecasts.
