# US_Price_Homes-Final_Submission
Our aim is to find publicly available data for key *supply-demand* factors that influence US home prices *nationally*. Then, build a data science model that explains how these factors impacted home prices over the last 20 years. Use the S&amp;P Case-Schiller Home Price Index as a proxy for home prices: fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CSUSHPISA.
